Symply SoundBoard

Original Project
https://github.com/ZenitH-AT/JNSoundboard

A very simple soundboard that allows you to add as many buttons as you want to be able to play your sounds.<br>
A left click plays the sound.<br>
A middle click allows you to modify the name of the button.<br>
A right click allows to select the audio file.<br>

Profiles, button configuration and other parameters are saved in an SQLite database.<br>

Use [VB-CABLE](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm) to create a virtual sound card.<br>

Set the default virtual input sound card.<br>
Then in your microphone settings, select "Listen to this device" and choose "Cable Input".<br>

In the application, in "Virtual Cable" choose "Cable Input", in microphone, your microphone and in Playback Device, your preferred audio output (Headphones, speaker)
